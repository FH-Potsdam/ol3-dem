ol3js-dem
=========

This is a experimental fork of OpenLayers 3 to render digital elevation models using the integrated webgl shader.
The application is not running stable yet and serves only testing purposes.

Features at current stage:

 * Plan Oblique Relief
 * Hypsometric Tinting
 * Waterbody Detection
 * Hillshading

Ordinary raster dems such as GeoTif can be used. The input data has to be encoded and converted into a set of tiles before it can be read by ol3. 

A [working demo](http://ol3dem.boeppe.eu/) is currently available for the eu-dem (Digital Elevation Model of the European Environment Agency).
